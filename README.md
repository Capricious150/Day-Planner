Each Time Block will be color-coded based on whether or not they're in the past, present, or future vs. the current local time. 

Click into the colored section and type to enter your intinerary.

Clicking a "Save" button will save the text in a timeblock to localStorage. It will be preserved on future pageloads.

### Design and Philosophy:
This was a fun little project. 

It was powered by the moment.js api and jQuery. All of the elements were dynamically added to the page by JavaScript, so the index.html page and style.css page are both extremely lightweight. 

This project expanded my understanding of event targeting, event delegation, parsing items from localstorage, and the use of third-party APIs.
